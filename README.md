# Flask-BBSWeb
A variation of Big Brain Security that runs on a remote server and uses Flask RESTful.

Most of my free time is being used studying linear algebra, regression, and forensics at the moment. 
I've decided not to waste a lot of time learning RESTful web services because someone else 
can write that section of the program for me. I'm more concerned with figuring out how to develop
a machine learning model to do forensic analysis for me.
